Bad:
```js
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It's hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
```

Good:
```js
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```

## Why

* It aids rapid understanding of what a function does without reading all the source code or referring to tests.
