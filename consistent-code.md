Code should be formatted the same way and enforced automatically using tools.

## Why

* Code is read much more often than it is written, the more familiar the conventions the easier code reviews, visual parsing and code comprehension become.
* Code conventions are learned quickly. Automatic enforcement exposes the developer repeatedly to the same errors making learning comfortable and at their own pace.
* Less mistakes. Code errors are raised straight away. In some cases they are fixed automatically.
* Constrains choices. More focus on engineering problems rather than distracted by inconsistent code or uncommon language features.
* Reduces conflict. Minor decisions, such as spacing and formatting, no longer need to be debated.

## How

* Use a static language to prevent errors.
* Use a linter (e.g. eslint, python) or formatter (e.g. gofmt) to enforce standards.
* Adhere to common language conventions or standards (e.g. Python's pep8).
* In languages where a common convention hasn't been decided. Opt for popular third party configurations. There will be a higher chance that this will make third party libraries easier to read and the rules can be reduced to suit the teams preferences.
* Link tools to IDE/Editor for rapid feedback.

[//]: # "It is significantly harder as a team to decide on possibly unknown individual rules from scratch and build your own standard."
