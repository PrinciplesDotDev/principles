Focus on the big picture from the beginning and then refine the detail once you have a grasp of the high-level conceptually.

When building something, it is better to understand the overall domain - at a high level - instead of focusing on the thing you need to build immediately.

## Why

* This allows a team to see the overall picture and will design a system that is more flexible
* It allows the team to peer into the future, to understand areas which need great detail to focus on and then
* To anticipate where you are going
* Engineers will create less rigid Software because they are aware of the upcoming direction.
* The team will have a better understanding of the overall picture, allowing them to make better decisions

### Example

Suppose a species evolves in a limited environment, such as a cold pool of water. The species will naturally adapt and optimize to that environment. That species when exposed to more varied environments (e.g. jungles, forests, etc.) would take many more generations to adapt to the new environment, than if it had access to those environments from the beginning.

The analogy applies to designing a system. If you focus on the smallest set of the domain from the beginning, not noticing upcoming changes, then the Software is more rigid and becomes significantly harder to change.
