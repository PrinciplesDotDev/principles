Core logic that is related to solving a business or domain problem should exist outside of a framework.

## Why

- Core logic is the most valuable asset of the business. A framework change with the core logic integrated results in a loss of that asset. Separation from the framework keeps the asset whilst allowing the framework to change.
- Separating core logic lets you use your own principles instead of the frameworks. Frameworks provide structure and useful abstractions that make engineering easier. Yet, using a framework often means using its principles at the expense of your own.
- You can solve your business problem better. Because a framework is not created to solve your particular problem, it cannot know the best way to solve it.
- Code is easier to read. You only need to understand the programming language, not the framework.
- Code is easier to test. It is not wrapped in a framework's abstractions.
## How

* Abstract code that is wrapped inside the framework to separate files
* Use software engineering concepts such as domain-driven design to structure code based on business requirements.
* Use principles to give the team confidence and create autonomy to design a system.
* Use design patterns and principles when designing a system. e.g. repository pattern, inversion of control, solid principles, etc.

##Â Article

One of the most costly decisions I've come across in Software Engineering that must cost billions in lost value is building business logic entirely inside the confines of a framework.

Business logic wrapped entirely inside a framework is a bit like living in a house and nailing all your items in place. You can't take anything with you when you leave except your memories. Moving house means all your precious items get left behind.

This analogy often happens with frameworks; instead of using the framework as a tool, all business logic is put inside and becomes inseparable.

Changing the framework means losing that asset.

### It takes experience

It is the dividing line between an experienced software engineer and a junior: *Juniors rely on frameworks - senior ones use frameworks as tools.*

It is why experienced software engineers are more valuable to businesses in the long run.

It also applies to teams: *Unaligned teams **have** to rely on frameworks - aligned ones can use frameworks as tools.*

It is why principles are so helpful - they align teams.

## Basic example of abstracting code from a framework

The below example is from a redux framework in which a reducer - a redux concept - adds a todo item into the application:

```js
function nextTodoId(todos) {
  const maxId = todos.reduce((maxId, todo) => Math.max(todo.id, maxId), -1);
  return maxId + 1;
}

function todosReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "todos/todoAdded": {
      return [
        ...state,
        // Core logic start
        {
          id: nextTodoId(state),
          text: action.payload,
          completed: false,
        },
        // Core logic end
      ];
    }
  }
}
```

Extracting the core logic, the framework code now looks like this:

```js
import { todoAdd } from "./todo";

function todosReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "todos/todoAdded": {
      return todoAdd(state, action.payload);
    }
  }
}
```

Core logic is then moved into a new file. Separate from the framework.

```js
function nextTodoId(todos) {
  const maxId = todos.reduce((maxId, todo) => Math.max(todo.id, maxId), -1);
  return maxId + 1;
}

function todoAdd(todos, text) {
  const nextId = nextTodoId(todos);
  const newToDoEntry = {
    id: nextId,
    text: text,
    completed: false,
  };
  return { ...todos, newToDoEntry };
}
```

## Exceptions

- If your core logic is trivial or has limited business value.
