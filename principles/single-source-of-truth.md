Data should be held in one location, duplicates of that data should be by reference only.

## Why

- Changes to data are always propagated to the rest of the system.
- Mutations to the data need only happen in one place.
- Single source of truth means no data will be out of sync or fail to be updated.

## How

Only allow data writes to happen in one location. Whether that be a call to a rest API, system call or other write actions.

Don't allow data to be stored anywhere but the single source of truth.

## Exceptions

**Highly distributed systems** Some systems rely on data consistency to be reached eventually or may never need to have accurate data.

<!--**Between teams** This principle is harder to apply between different team specialisations such as front-end vs backend, teams within an organisation, between different systems: caching vs database or large distributed systems.-->
