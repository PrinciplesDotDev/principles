Don't worry about optimizing code. Rely on the computer to do the work. Compute or derive values when possible. When you have a small user base, a small amount of data and huge amounts of CPU available, performance isn't a concern. Why? Performant code tends to be much more complicated code and will slow down delivery.

##Â Phase
This principle is useful for early phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) such an MVP.
