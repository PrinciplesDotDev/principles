When building something, it is better to understand the overall domain of what you are building - at a high level - as opposed to focusing on the short term.

## Why

* This allows a team to see the overall picture
* To anticipate where you are going
* Ensure the software is less rigid.

### Example

If a species evolves in a limited environment such as a cold pool of water (i.e. slim set of features), it will adapt to that environment exclusively and specialise, whereas that environment is more varied (i.e. wide set of features), it will be more generalist and less specialised. It is non-rigid - it can adapt to change more readily.
