Focus on the big picture from the beginning and then refine the detail once you have a grasp of the high-level conceptually. Keeping iterating to build a wider picture as necessary.

When creating something, it is better to understand the picture - at a high level - instead of focusing on the thing you need to create immediately.


Suppose a species evolves in a limited environment, such as a cold pool of water. The species will naturally adapt and optimize to that environment. That species when exposed to more varied environments (e.g. jungles, forests, etc.) would take many more generations to adapt to the new environment, than if it had access to those environments from the beginning.

The analogy applies to designing any system. If you focus on a small part of it from the beginning, not noticing upcoming direction, then change is significantly harder.

## Why (in software)

(In software)
* The software is adaptable to future change, it allows a team to see the overall picture and to design a system that can anticipate future change.
* Lightly designing a system from the beginning allows you to peer into the future and see what you're going to need and what you need to understand
* Peering into the future  stretching people's understanding and lets people focus in great detail to focus now and leave to later
* Engineers create less rigid Software because they are aware of the upcoming direction.
* Leaders create more adaptable organisations
* The team will have a better understanding of the overall picture, allowing them to make better decisions

##Â Why (leadership)

* It allows other parts of the team or organisation to figure out conceptually what you need to iterate on before it is built.



## Thoughts

Organisation-wide decisions: A banking start-up makes a current account that is used in a single country. Monzo, in the UK is a good example of that. If the long-term strategy is to be in multiple countries, a go wide and refine approach would is to think about multi-currency support from the beginning. It is a much larger shift strategically, culturally, operationally and technically to do that later on.

Software: When building an MVP a system has been defined that accepts purchases from credit cards, the team focuses on supporting that use case alone. Once they are happy with the purchase flow, they realise they need to support refunds. Adding

application that is made for use in a single country, say the UK. The whole application is built upon accomodating
