When building something, it is better to understand the overall domain - at a high level - as opposed to focusing on the thing you need to immediately build.

## Why

* This allows a team to see the overall picture
* To anticipate where you are going
* Ensures the software is created in a way that is less rigid.

### Example

If a species evolves in a limited environment such as a cold pool of water (i.e. slim set of features), it will adapt to that environment exclusively and specialize, whereas that environment is more varied (i.e. wide set of features), it will be more generalist and less specialized. It is non-rigid - it can adapt to change more readily.
