# Principles 

An open-source list of principles used in software engineering and leadership to improve capability. 

If you have your own principles, you can contribute them to the repository (see below)

This repository is also the main data source for https://principles.dev. Any changes here will be reflected on the website.

## Creating your first principle

You can create your principle by using the [Editor](https://principles.dev/editor/) and what you need to include by reading [how to write a principle](https://principles.dev/documentation/#how-to-write-a-principle_1).


## Contributing

If you want to make Software Engineering better for everybody, please make a pull request. You can create a pull request and add your own principles or update others with the merge target set to **release** branch.

You might want to read [why create a principle](https://principles.dev/why-create-principle/).

There are many ways to contribute to the project, from simple to most rewarding: 

* **Correct mistakes** -  This could be spelling, grammar or getting the point across more clearly.
* **Edit a principle** - enrich its content. Nearly all principles can be improved by adding in more information or better reasoning.
* **Copy an existing principle** - Derive a principle from elsewhere. Make sure it has a permissible license (e.g., MIT, CC BY-SA).
* **Create a principle** - Have a principle of your own? Please share it with the world on principles.dev. 

If you're creating or copying a principle. You should at least read through the [how to write a principle](https://principles.dev/documentation/) quickstart section before you begin. Having a look at existing principles on the site will help you understand what's required.

One of the most significant sources of friction you will experience that will hold you back from contributing is whether you feel your principle will be rejected or not. No one wants to put in work for someone to turn around and say no. 

It will generally be approved if it reaches the requirement for a [basic principle](https://principles.dev/documentation/#quickstart-writing-your-first-principle). 

Reasons for lack of approval are:

* Low quality
* Not containing what it is and why
* Multiple principles combined in one file
* The principle would is offensive, inflammatory, or is generally targetted at being hostile towards a different group (e.g., don't use X language, X technology, etc.)
* Grammar or spelling mistakes (which are easily correctable)

If you are unsure, it's ok to open an issue on this repository to discuss a principle to get some general pointers. 

Thank you for reading and making Software Engineering better for everyone.
