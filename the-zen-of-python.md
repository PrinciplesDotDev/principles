Tim Peters is one of the major contributors to the Python language and it's most popular implementation CPython. He succinctly channels the language's philosophy and "way of life" in a set of principles, guiding python developers and contributors since.

These principles are incorporated into the official Python literature as Python Enhancement Proposal 20 (known as PEP-20) and in the Python interpreter as an easter egg.

## The Zen of Python

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than *right* now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Python Terminal (easter egg)

In any Python terminal, a developer can display those principals in times of doubt.

```
# python terminal
>>> import this
```
