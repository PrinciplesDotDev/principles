Systems which can evolve quicker are better than those which cannot.

Systems which have the quality of evolvability can rapidly adapt to their environment and change direction quickly, without being encumbered by previous evolutions. It allows the maximum amount of change with the minimum amount of effort.

#### Definitions
Evolvability is defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive evolution.
