Conditional logic should avoid double negatives. e.g., "Is this not not true?"

## Why

- Double negatives are hard to comprehend.

## How

- Write logic that asks: Is this true. Instead of: Is this not not true?

## Example

A double negative conditional, which is hard to understand:

```js
if (!isNotSelected) {
    ...
```

Then written in the positive:

```js
if (isSelected) {
   ...
```
