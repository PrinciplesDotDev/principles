When encountering documentation, it should be easy to make changes.

## Why

- Increases the chances that the documentation will be correct.
- Increase productivity through accurate documentation.

## How

- Prioritize write access to the code base for all members, especially new members of the team. It's often the time they are most likely to find errors and update, but usually have the least access to do so.
- Encourage developers to update any inaccurate documentation.
