"Make the invisible, visible" means: make *relevant* information visible so we can understand things clearly. This principle is at the root of understanding of all things.

Making relevant information visible increases understanding, allowing you to do more: Better problem-solving, behaviours, and code bases. Without making relevant information visible, it creates a deficit in understanding. How can you understand anything correctly - whether it be a team, organization or code base - if there is a knowledge gap due to invisible relevant information?


## How to determine relevancy

Determining what is relevant is crucial, as in any system *there are always more irrelevant details than relevant ones*. Let's take a coin as an example of this phenomenon. A coin has printed faces, often with a production date on one side and the currency value on another. It also has many other properties: weight, mass, electrical conductivity, melting point, metallic composition, etc. Focusing on just one of those properties, such as the metallic composition, reveals an even more significant number of possible attributes, such as a mixture of numerous elements. Within those elements are an arrangement of atoms and within the atoms; quarks. Deeper still are further complexities at the quantum level. Most of those properties are irrelevant and invisible, but depending on your perspective, some are *relevant but unfortunately invisible*. To make the invisible, visible - we need to find what is relevant and make that visible.

You can determine relevancy by asking two related questions:

1. **"What information would be useful in helping me understand this better?"**  - This will generate many answers while ignoring your existing limitations.
2. **What information would be helpful for others to understand this better?** - This will help you think about your users and other perspectives.

Going back to the coin example, you and I probably only care what the printed value of a coin. But if you were a precious metal dealer instead, what is relevant to you about coins is now different - it is based upon the underlying metals' worth. To know its worth, we need to know the type of precious metal, its quantity, and its purity.

The "sixpence" is a precious coin made from gold, but it wouldn't make a good coin for precious metal dealing as its relevant properties are invisible. We need to find out what it's made from, the weight of that material, and its purity. To make those properties visible, you would need to test the metal to determine its properties or rely on documentation elsewhere.

The "Britannia" on the other hand, has all its relevant properties visible: It is made of gold, 1oz of it, with a 999.9 purity (24 carats). If we were to make the sixpence into a coin for trading precious metals, we would "make the invisible, visible" by updating the coin design to be closer to that of the Brittania.

Unfortunately, in most systems, hidden relevant information is obscured, reducing our understanding. Behaviours are a widespread example of relevant information being invisible. Hidden behaviours cause unaligned teams, dysfunctional organizations and complex code bases. Because those behaviours are in our minds, they often aren't visible. From a leadership perspective, people don't know how to act. From a code perspective, engineers don't know why the code is written like it is. Hidden behaviours are solved by using principles, which create visible, sharable behaviour that others can interrogate and align to. "Make the invisible, visible" is the reason why any principles exist at all.


## Examples

Further examples of making relevant information visible.

Data

* Create visualizations that create insight.
* Convert data into visualizations that are easier to understand. (e.g., grafana, splunk)
* Run calculations on the data to understand the content (e.g., average price, top sales)
* Use analytics within a system to increase feedback cycles.
* Data mining a dataset to reveal hidden patterns.

Code

* Use diagrams. Represent code in less abstract ways, such as drawing diagrams of a system using pen and paper or graphics design programs.
* Log and visualize the results of a system.
* Use debuggers to peer inside a system to see changes over time rather than an input-output black box.
* Use performance tools like flame graphs to visualize where the program spends its time.

Teams

* Use principles to communicate and build mental models everyone can share in the team.
* Ask questions that seek to understand and illuminate.

Individuals

* Understand and share your knowledge, codifying your habits into understood actions and principles.
